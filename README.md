* Account Actions: Users can perform essential account actions, including checking balances, withdrawing funds, depositing funds, and transferring funds between accounts.
* Security: The application ensures the security of user information through a password-protected login system.
* Data Management: User account data is stored in a secure HashMap data structure.
* Error Handling: The application handles input errors and provides appropriate error messages to users.




## Getting Started

To run the ATM Management Interface locally on your machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/MeftohuAhmed/ATM-Management-Interface.git
    
2. Navigate to the project directory: 

    cd Atm-Management-Interface
    
3. Compile the Java files:

    javac *.java
    
4. Run the application: 
  
    java ATM




## Usage
